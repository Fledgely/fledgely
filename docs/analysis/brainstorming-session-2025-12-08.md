# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Cns
**Date:** 2025-12-08

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Opportunity discovery - uncovering blind spots and unexplored possibilities for fledgely
**Goals:** Surface additional scope and features that could be critical success factors

### Session Setup

- **Approach Selected:** AI-Recommended Techniques
- **Focus Area:** Identifying unexplored opportunities and discovering additional scope/features to ensure project success

## Product Context

**What is fledgely?**

Fledgely provides young users freedom to explore the Internet while giving parents/guardians effective supervision that respects the child's privacy. It promotes healthy screen time balance and protects homework time from infringing on fun/gaming time.

**Key Differentiators:**
- Cross-platform aggregate screen time control (multiple devices, different OSes)
- Meaningful AI integration (not just keyword blocking)
- Open source and free to self-host
- Open APIs for ecosystem integration (IoT, Home Assistant, etc.)
- Potential SaaS offering based on community demand

**Core Philosophy:**
> Fledgely provides **supervision and safety guardrails through consent** - not imposed control, but an agreed-upon protection framework. It's a **safety tool, not a policing tool**. The core promise: **"freedom and safety without sitting next to them the entire time."**

## Technique Execution Results

### Technique 1: Question Storming

**Focus:** Generate questions to reveal blind spots and unexplored territories

**Questions Surfaced by Theme:**

**User Value & Motivation**
- Why would a young user *want* this vs. resist it?
- What does the young user tell their friends about fledgely?
- What's the "graduation" moment - when is fledgely no longer needed?

**Technical Edge Cases**
- What happens offline or when service is unavailable?
- How does it know homework vs. fun? (YouTube tutorials, game design courses)
- What about neurodivergent users where "focus" looks different?

**Privacy & Data**
- Who can see my data and activity history?
- What happens to data if we stop using fledgely?
- Does my data train the AI for other families?

**Trust & Safety**
- What if I accidentally find adult content I wasn't expecting?
- What if my parent is the danger, not the internet?
- An adult found this installed without consent - what now? (stalkerware differentiation)

**Adversarial Scenarios**
- How do I circumvent these controls?
- Why wouldn't I just use a VPN or second device?
- How do I uninstall this?

**Competitor & Market**
- Why isn't Apple Screen Time or Google Family Link enough?
- What market does fledgely create that doesn't exist yet?
- Who is currently underserved by existing solutions?

**Business Model**
- How does open source pay the bills?
- What would people actually pay for vs. expect for free?
- What's the AI cost per family for SaaS viability?

**Offline & Delegation**
- Rolling one-time PINs for offline unlock
- Scoped temporary PINs for caregivers (babysitter, grandparents)
- Trust tiers with permission boundaries and time limits

### Technique 2: Cross-Pollination

**Focus:** Borrow ideas from unrelated industries

**Industries Analyzed:** Banking, Aviation, Healthcare, Gaming, Hospitality, Enterprise IT, Libraries, Automotive, Theme Parks

**Key Features Borrowed:**

| Source Industry | Feature Adapted |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Banking | Trust tiers for delegated access (like authorized users) |
| Aviation | "Black box" logging - only reviewed if incident occurs |
| Healthcare | Triage levels (info → warning → urgent → emergency) |
| Healthcare | AI conversation guidance for discussing flagged content |
| Hospitality | Concierge alternatives ("not this, but how about...") |
| Hospitality | Time extension request workflow |
| Enterprise IT | Family digital agreement (like Acceptable Use Policy) |
| Theme Parks | Emergency "help" button bypassing all restrictions |
| Theme Parks | Countdown warnings before time ends |
| Automotive | Progressive "digital license" based on maturity |

---

### Technique 3: SCAMPER Method

**Systematic 7-lens exploration of fledgely**

**S - Substitute**
- AI suggests age-appropriate defaults (with local law reference)
- Both time AND activity quality measurement (parent chooses)
- Block → Warn → Log → Allow spectrum + Emergency Lockout

**C - Combine**
- Productive vs leisure view with app/website breakdown
- Alert arrives WITH AI conversation guidance
- Onboarding includes family agreement (renewed every 6 months per child)
- Child dashboard: headline time (offline-capable) + detailed breakdown (online)
- Same data visibility for parent and child (except blocked content history)

**A - Adapt**
- Focus sprints (Pomodoro-style)
- App Store ratings as default baselines
- School schedule sync via API (more freedom during holidays)
- WCAG 2.2 AAA accessibility compliance
- Data export/deletion rights at 18 (or local law)

**M - Modify**
- Real-time alerts for concerns; weekly summary reports
- "Feels like sitting next to parent" as design principle
- Age by individual year (not brackets)
- Time measured to the second, continuous
- AI blocking aggressiveness varies by age
- Offline buffer configurable in days
- Minimum household: 1 parent, 1 child, 1 device

**P - Put to Other Uses**
- AI bookmark categorization & educational recommendations
- Family agreement as AI-readable document driving control suggestions
- Homework avoidance detection
- Device health notifications (updates, storage)
- Wellbeing trend tracking (unusual patterns)

**E - Eliminate**
- Complex dashboards (start simple)
- Daily check-ins (notify only when attention needed)
- Accusatory language (just facts, never "you've been bad")
- Fledgely as enforcer (parent says no, fledgely is their tool)

**R - Reverse**
- Restrictive default that feels protective, not imposing
- Child can see parent response time (accountability both ways)
- Child uses fledgely for self-regulation
- **Success metric:** Children excited to use the product

- **5 prioritized themes** with concrete action plans
- **Clear philosophy** articulated: "freedom and safety without sitting next to them"
- **Success metric defined:** Children excited to use the product

### Breakthrough Concepts

1. **AI-readable Family Agreement** - The "constitution" fledgely interprets and enforces
2. **Concierge Redirects** - Turns "NO" into helpful alternative suggestions
3. **AI Conversation Guidance** - Helps parents discuss flagged content with age-appropriate language
4. **Children Excited to Use It** - Ultimate success metric
5. **"Feels Like Sitting Next to Parent"** - Design principle for every feature decision

### Session Reflections

This session revealed that fledgely's true differentiation isn't just technical (cross-platform, AI, open source) - it's philosophical. The emphasis on **consent over control**, **safety over policing**, and **children wanting to use it** represents a fundamentally different approach to parental supervision software.

The prioritization of Integration & Ecosystem first reflects the open source community-building strategy - make fledgely extensible and the community will help build features that no single developer could anticipate.

### Creative Journey

The session progressed from **divergent exploration** (Question Storming revealing blind spots) through **external innovation** (Cross-Pollination borrowing from 9 industries) to **systematic coverage** (SCAMPER ensuring no gaps). The user consistently refined ideas toward the core philosophy, rejecting "gamification" and "reward" language in favor of "safety" and "consent" framing.
