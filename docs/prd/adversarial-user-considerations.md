# Adversarial User Considerations

## Design Principles

1. **Transparency defeats manipulation** - Child sees same data as parent
2. **Bypass visibility > bypass prevention** - Log what you can't block
3. **Consent makes bypass feel like betrayal** - Can't outsmart an agreement you created
4. **Legitimate privacy is not adversarial** - Respect real privacy needs
5. **Technical arms race is unwinnable** - Design for conversation, not control

## Adversary Response Matrix

| Adversary Type | System Response |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Technical bypass (VPN, etc.) | Detect and log transparently; unclassifiable traffic visible to all |
| Social engineering | Same data visible to all parties; manipulation claims verifiable |
| Loophole exploitation | AI pattern detection; anomalies surfaced for family discussion |
| Legitimate privacy seeking | Generous allowlist; health, identity, crisis resources protected |
| Hostile non-compliance | Device inoperable without consent; this is by design |
| Accidental violations | Pattern vs accident distinction; mercy for mistakes |
