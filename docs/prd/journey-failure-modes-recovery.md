# Journey Failure Modes & Recovery

## Setup & Onboarding Failures

| Failure | Recovery |
|---------|----------|
| Child refuses consent | Pre-setup family discussion guide; device inoperable is by design |
| Parents disagree on rules | Co-parent agreement required first; mediation prompts |
| QR enrollment fails | Manual code entry fallback; longer expiration |

## Classification & AI Failures

| Failure | Recovery |
|---------|----------|
| AI misclassifies homework | Quick correction mechanism; family feedback loop; apology messaging |
| Crisis resource not on allowlist | AI detection adds dynamically; conservative approach to privacy |

## Delegated Access Failures

| Failure | Recovery |
|---------|----------|
| Caregiver loses PIN | PIN recovery via parent; backup contact |
| Child manipulates caregiver | Override confirmation prompt; differs-from-usual warning |
| PIN shared with child | PIN only works from registered caregiver device |

## Critical Recovery Principles

1. **Never lock out homework** - Educational access preserved in every failure mode
2. **Graceful degradation** - Partial function beats total failure
3. **Trust repair** - Acknowledge failures; apologize when system is wrong
4. **Human escalation** - Every automated failure has human override path
5. **Transparency** - Tell users when something went wrong and why
