# Edge Cases & Special Scenarios

## Divorced Parents - Shared Custody

**Approach:** Unified agreement (primary), location-based rules (fallback)

Both parents must agree on a single family agreement. If parents cannot agree, system offers location-based rules as compromise. Safety settings (crisis allowlist, age restrictions) always require both parents regardless of approach.

## Neurodivergent Children

**Accommodations:**
- Extended countdown warnings (30 min → 15 min → 5 min → 2 min)
- Flexible "focus mode" for hyperfocus patterns
- Custom activity categories per child
- AI pattern learning per individual child
- Transition support features

## Shared Device, Multiple Children

**Approach:** Device profiles per child
- Multi-profile single device support
- Child profile switching with PIN
- Per-profile content filtering and time tracking
- Individual time allocations on shared device

## Blended Families

**Permission Levels:**
- Primary Parent: Full control
- Co-Parent: Full control, agreement changes require primary approval
- Trusted Adult: Caregiver-level plus full activity view

## Working Teens

**Work Mode Features:**
- Specific apps unrestricted during configured hours
- Schedule import from calendar
- Location-aware work mode activation
- Work app allowlist (games still restricted)

## Technical Bypass Attempts

**Philosophy:** Transparency defeats manipulation
- VPN/proxy detection with transparent logging
- Unclassifiable traffic visible to child and parent
- Bypass framed as agreement violation, not crime
- Can't win arms race; design for conversation
