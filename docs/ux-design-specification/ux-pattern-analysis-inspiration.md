| **Airbnb** | Two parties who don't fully trust each other | Mutual trust; two-way accountability; visible rules |

## Journey Design Principles

1. **Every journey has a clear emotional arc** - Not just functional steps
2. **Celebration proportional to effort** - Daily: quick; Milestone: elaborate; Graduation: ceremony
3. **Child perspective comes first** - Design from child's emotional needs, then parent's
4. **Conflict journeys end in resolution** - Never leave parties in adversarial state
5. **Crisis journeys prioritize calm** - Opposite of alarm aesthetic
6. **Screenshots are protective freedom** - Never frame monitoring as punishment to be reduced
