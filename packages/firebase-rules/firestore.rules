 * Fledgely Firestore Security Rules
 *
 * Default: Deny all access
 * Individual rules will be added as features are implemented.
 *
 * Security principles:
 * - Deny by default
 * - Least privilege
 * - Users can only access their own data
 * - Guardians can access children they're authorized for
 * - No data leakage across families
